_bake_ is a small tool that is able to read a directory tree of HTML and
Markdown files and turns them into a website. It allows defining templates for
the Markdown files.

It is intended to be used as a post-receive hook for a GIT repository, that
turns the contents of the repository into a website. This way it can be used as
a CMS.

Future plans include automatic generation of an page index as well as a Atom/RSS
feed.
